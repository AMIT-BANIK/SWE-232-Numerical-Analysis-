# Comparison between Bisection and False method 

The False Position method is faster than the Bisection method.It also requires fewer iterations.

For example,f(x) = 4x^2 + 3x - 3 using the function in the interval [0,1] with a tolerance of 0.05, the False Position method finds the root in just 3 iterations, while the Bisection method requires 5 iterations.

Therefore, we can say that the False Position method performs better in most cases.
The comparison is shown in the Task2.java file.
