# *Comparison between Bisection and False method *

The False Position method is faster than the Bisection method.It also requires fewer iterations.

For example, using the function in the interval  with a tolerance of 0.05, the False Position method finds the root in just 3 iterations, while the Bisection method requires 5 iterations.

Therefore, we can say that the False Position method performs better in most cases.
The comparison is shown in the Task2.java file.
